# MDNrepo

This is a project that was posted on the mdn website. This is a project that helped me truly undetstand Json. It includes a link<br>
to the JSON file located in the mdn github repository. 

It includes several re-edits that I had to make, due to "de-bugging". This is pretty basic, but a very good exercise for learning
Json.
